# CSCE-310

The purpose of this repository is to store all my work from CSCE 310- Data Structures & Algorithms. 

HOMEWORK 1
Part 1 is a function that takes in an unsigned long long int and outputs the number of odd digits in that number. 
Part 2 returns the first n lexicographical permutations of a string.

HOMEWORK 2
Part 1 is a standard 2-Sum Problem. 
Part 2 solves for the maximum number of overlapping intervals, given 2 arrays(1 for starting values and the other for ending values of intervals).
Part 3 returns the number of comparisons needed to identify the nth number, using the Quickselect algorithm.

HOMEWORK 3-Trees and Graphs
Part 1 is my implementation of Prim's algorithm to compute the Minimum Spanning Tree of a given adjacency Matrix. 
Part 2 is my implementation of the first i iterations Floyd's Algorithm to find the shortest path of a MST.
Part 3 is an implementation of Horner's rule to solve a polynomial at a given x value.

HOMEWORK 4-Dynamic Programming
Part 1 is an optimal binary search tree constructor. It takes in a list of probabilities of searches, and determines the average number of searches for the optimal tree.
Part 2 computes Pell's Number using a window of values that are kept track of to increase efficiency.
Part 3 returns true or false depending on whether 3 groups of even weights can be made given a list of numbers.

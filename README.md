# CSCE-310

The purpose of this repository is to store all my work from CSCE 310- Data Structures & Algorithms. 

EDIT 1: Added csce310homework01part01 and csce310homework01part02. Part 1 is a function that takes in an unsigned long long int and outputs the number of odd digits in that number. Part 2 returns the first n lexicographical permutations of a string.
